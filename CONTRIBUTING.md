# Contribution Guideline

## Contribution Welcome!

PMedis is a community-driven opensource project. We welcome all kinds of contributions, such as bugfix, new feature development, test cases, documentations and so on. 

## PMedis Contribution Workflow

### Before Opening Your PR

We encourage you to discuss with us first before coding. Your discussion channel may depend on what you want to contribute:

- If it is a simple bugfix, or an independent function/module that will not affect other modules: You may just raise an issue on our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/memark-io/pmedis/issues) and describe your solutions. We will provide necessary feedback to you as soon as possible.
- If the change may affect a few modules, or an architectural change/improvement: Please contact us in the community and let us have more understanding about your ideas. 

### Code Contribution Workflow

Here is the general contribution workflow:

- Fork the PMedis repository into your personal space
- Create a branch from where you want to base your code (usually it is the main branch)
- Make commits of your code and test cases, make sure:
  - your coding style follows our [code convention](https://github.com/memark-io/pmedis/blob/main/doc/style-guide/code-convention.md)
  - the commit messages follow our [commit convention](https://github.com/memark-io/pmedis/blob/main/doc/style-guide/commit-convention.md)

- Push your commits to your forked repository
- Submit a pull request to merge from your branch to the PMedis's main branch
- Address any comments from our community about your PR
- The PR will be merged by our maintainers after all comments are addressed.
